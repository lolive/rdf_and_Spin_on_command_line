rdf_and_Spin_on_command_line
============================

Description:

Running your owl+spin against rdf data, all from the commande line



Steps to run:

First, you need Java.
Then, you need a Unix shell.

Then:
Your data model, and SPIN rules, should be in file model.owl.
Your data should be in file data.rdf.
Both should be RDF/Turtle files.

Then run:
./run.sh

and you should see the constraint violations.
